# FickianModel
Modelling Fickian diffusion and concentration profile of species in solution, 
flowing through a microfluidic device.

Microfluidic device consists of 3 inlets, each with a channel that joins
a larger main channel at the same point. Solutions are pumped through all 3
inlets at the same flow rate. 
        
This very simple model neglects parabolic velocity profile that forms in 
laminar flows, and the electrostatic or dispersive interactions between 
species on solution.
